## Design Choices  

### Colour Scheme/Images 

I first started looking at the colors I would use for my website. I decided blue because blue is the color that represents autism and blue is associated with trustworthiness, honesty, reliablity and is used a lot in the health sector which autism is a part of. However I then realized that I will be adding images and that they need to go well with the websites colour scheme so I started looking at the images I will include in my website then decide on the color scheme. I decided on the images from [freepix](https://www.freepik.com/author/vectorjuice)(credited in the credits section) and found a color scheme based on the images using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/). I decided to stick with the blue theme still as it represents autism, but use the type of blue in the images (#4243E4). I then looked on the website [color hexa](https://www.colorhexa.com) for different shades and tints, and found #CBCCF8 a lighter tint to go together with the blue. I want to keep the colors clean and simple so the user can focus on the information and content but with it still looking appealing.

### Typography  

Google fonts was used for the fonts: 

* Roboto wich is used for body text, its a sans-serif font. 
* Archivo used for headings which is a sans-serif font. 

### Wireframes  

* [Home page]() 
* [Signs page]() 
* [Contact us page]() 

### Accessibility  

### Fonts 

Roboto and archivo pair well together. Roboto uses simplified characters which stand apart from each other and appear easier to read for users with dyslexia and visual impairment.
