## Design Choices  

### Colour Scheme/Images 

I first started looking at the colors I would use for my website. I decided blue because blue is the color that represents autism and blue is associated with trustworthiness, honesty, reliablity and is used a lot in the health sector which autism is a part of. However I then realized that I will be adding images and that they need to go well with the websites colour scheme so I started looking at the images I will include in my website then decide on the color scheme. 

I decided on the images from [freepix](https://www.freepik.com/author/vectorjuice)(credited in the credits section) and found a color scheme based on the images using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/). I decided to stick with the blue theme still as it represents autism, but use the type of blue in the images (#4243E4). 

I then looked on the website [color hexa](https://www.colorhexa.com) for different shades and tints, and found #CBCCF8 a lighter tint to go together with the blue. I want to keep the colors clean and simple so the user can focus on the information and content but with it still looking appealing.

![shades of blue chosen](documentation/shades.png) ![color hex](documentation/colorhex2.png) 

### Imagery
All images have the same colours so they are consistent and appealing to the eye. Users wont get confused with different colours and the images are user friendly for all ages.

### Typography  

Google fonts was used for the fonts: 

* The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font which uses simplified characters that stand apart from each other and appear easier to read for users with dyslexia and visual impairment.
* Archivo used for headings which is a sans-serif font. 

### Wireframes  

* [Home page](documentation/homepagewireframe.png) 
* [Signs page](documentation/signspagewireframe.png) 
* [Contact us page](documentation/contactuswireframe.png) 

## Features
The website is comprised of 3 pages, in which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, signs page, contact us page).

#### All pages on website have:
A responsive navigation bar, at the top of the page under the heading, which allows the user to navigate through the site. The navigation bar consists of links to each page and lines vertically when in mobile view. A footer which contains links to social media account such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.

#### Home page:
What is autism section- explains what autism is with an image to the right of the text. Information on how many people have autism with a YouTube video (what is autism) to the right of the text. 

#### Signs page: 
Signs in children and adults with a picture in the middle. Signs of autism in girls' section – text explaining autism in girls with an image to the right.

#### Contact us page: 
Form that contains name, email address and ‘your message’ section for the user to write what they would like to contact about. The user submits this by using the submit button. Users must fill in the name, email and message area to submit if they don’t a tooltip guides users to fill in sections they have missed. Once you submit, the user will be taken to a thank you page which has a message saying thankyou for contacting us!!

#### Thank you page:
Has a comment saying thankyou for contacting and a sentence saying we will be back in touch soon. And an image beneath tying all the images used on the website together. 

### Accessibility  

I have been mindful during the coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible and easy to find by marking the current page with a line 
 underneath the title.

### Fonts 

Roboto and archivo pair well together. Roboto uses simplified characters which stand apart from each other and appear easier to read for users with dyslexia and visual impairment.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import roboto and archivo font into style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
2. [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons to footer links for aesthetic and UX purposes.
3. [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) was used on the navbar menu so when you hover over on one of the items a line appears underneath.
4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
5. [Github](https://github.com) is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

7. [Compress png](https://compresspng.com/) to compress images.
8. [Retoucher](https://retoucher.online/) to remove background of images.

## Testing
Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build of the webiste. I utilised Chrome Developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

### Bugs

#### First project meeting with my mentor:
1. My images were wider than the rest of my main content while on mobile view
   * I solved this by removing the background of the images and reducing the size so it would fit better on different screen sizes.
     ![Home page image](documentation/imagebug.png)
2. My tiles and content were not alligned on larger screens, so I alligned and styled all headings and content consistent throughout the website.
3. On larger screens my footer, floated a little up the page with a bar below. I solved this by removing the height style in my media query.
4. There was too much text and content, so I cut down the amount of information throughout the webiste.

#### Whilst coding
* My footer seemed to slide to the left, so I inspected this and found the problem and resolved it by adding space above the footer so the image wasn't obstructing or in the way of the footer.
![Footer Bug](documentation/footerbug.png) 

#### Mid project meeting with my mentor:
1. On my contact page, when clicking the submit button, it wasnt being redirected to the thankyou.html page. I Solved this by adding the method and action to the form.
2. On certain sizes, there were issues with my page 2 top section. I fixed this by adding css media query.
   * ![Tablet bug](documentation/tabletbug.PNG)
3. The bottom section of the second page was different to the first, so it was recommended to maybe try keep the consistency so I decided to keep them consistent.

   ![Signs page 2nd section](documentation/signspage-bottomsec.png)
   
#### Whilst coding
* My contact and thankyou page were distorted when in tablet view and not filling the view properly. I fixed this by adding media query for tablet view and adding different styles.
  ![Contact, Thank you Bug](documentation/contacttabletbug.png)
* Whilst checking different devices on chrome tools I found that on galaxy fold the logo is too big and goes off the page.

### Lighthouse
I used Lighthouse chrome developer tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website. It was suggested to add meta description and aria label to my footers icons on each page, so I did this then tested again.

## Full testing 
To fully test the webiste, I performed the following testing on browsers(Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox) and on devices(MacBook Air 13 inch, Iphone 11, Iphone12, Iphone12 mini, Ipad 7th generation). I also went through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure the responsiveness on different screen sizes.
