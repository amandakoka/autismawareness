      <h1 class="left">What is Autism?</h1>
      <p class="left">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain.
      People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviours 
      or interests. They may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention. Being autistic does not mean 
      you have an illness or disease. It means your brain works in a different way from other people. It's something you're born with. 
      If you're autistic, you're autistic your whole life. Autism is not a medical condition with treatments or a "cure". But some 
      people need support to help them with certain things. Some people with ASD may require significant support in their daily lives, 
      while others may need less support and, in some cases, live entirely independently.<a href="signs.html"><strong> Signs of 
      autism</strong></a> usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear even earlier, and often, it can 
      be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Research shows that early intervention leads to positive outcomeslater in life for people 
      with autism.

      <h1 class="left">How many people have autism</h1>
      <p class="left">It is important to know how many autistic people there are for several reasons, including helping to provide 
        support, as well as showing the sheer number and diversity of autistic people. This is also called “autism prevalence”. It is 
        an estimate of how many autistic people there are in the UK. It is not the same as the number of autistic people who have a 
        diagnosis and many autistic people might not have been identified or even know yet themselves. As autism understanding has 
        grown, the estimated prevalence has also changed. Government prevalence surveys last estimated that around one in 100 people 
        are autistic. However, because these are estimates this is not definite. Other surveys and international estimates have come up 
        with different prevalence estimates. Most of them suggest autism prevalence is higher. The National Autistic Society thinks the 
        UK governments should do more research into autism prevalence to find an updated figure. Until that research is done, we 
        believe that more than one in 100 people are autistic, which means more than 700,000 people in the UK. Having an accurate 
        prevalence figure is vital. We all need to know this to improve support and understanding, and to create a society that works 
        for autistic people.
