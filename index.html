    <p class="left">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain.
      People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviours 
      or interests. People with ASD may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention. Being autistic does not mean 
      you have an illness or disease. It means your brain works in a different way from other people. It's something you're born with. 
      Signs of autism might be noticed when you're very young, or not until you're older. If you're autistic, you're autistic your 
      whole life. Autism is not a medical condition with treatments or a "cure". But some people need support to help them with certain 
      things.There is not one autism but many subtypes, most influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Because 
      autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people 
      with autism learn, think and problem-solve can range from highly skilled to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require 
      significant support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in some cases, live entirely independently. 
      Several factors may influence the development of autism, and it is often accompanied by sensory sensitivities and medical issues 
      such as gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, seizures or sleep disorders, as well as mental health challenges such as anxiety, 
      depression and attention issues.<a href="signs.html"><strong> Signs of autism</strong></a> usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some 
      associated development delays can appear even earlier, and often, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Research shows that 
      early intervention leads to positive outcomeslater in life for people with autism.

      <h1>How many people have autism</h1>
      <p class="left">It is important to know how many autistic people there are for several reasons, including helping to provide 
        support, as well as showing the sheer number and diversity of autistic people. This is also called “autism prevalence”. It is 
        an estimate of how many autistic people there are in the UK. It is not the same as the number of autistic people who have a 
        diagnosis and many autistic people might not have been identified or even know yet themselves. As autism understanding has 
        grown, the estimated prevalence has also changed. Government prevalence surveys last estimated that around one in 100 people 
        are autistic. However, because these are estimates this is not definite. Other surveys and international estimates have come up 
        with different prevalence estimates. Most of them suggest autism prevalence is higher. The National Autistic Society thinks the 
        UK governments should do more research into autism prevalence to find an updated figure. Until that research is done, we 
        believe that more than one in 100 people are autistic, which means more than 700,000 people in the UK. Having an accurate 
        prevalence figure is vital. We all need to know this to improve support and understanding, and to create a society that works 
        for autistic people.
