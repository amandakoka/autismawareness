      <h1>Signs of Autism in Girls</h1>
    </div>
     <p>Far more boys than girls are diagnosed with autism. But that might not be because more boys have autism. Often, autism in 
      girls just looks different from the stereotype of autistic behavior, so some doctors might not diagnose it. Repetitive 
      behavior, like flapping their hands, is one sign of autism that most doctors recognize. But girls with autism might not have 
      as many repetitive behaviors as boys, or they might be quieter about them. Having an intense interest in something specific 
      is also common in people with autism. If that interest is something considered “girly,” like horses, a doctor might dismiss 
      it as normal. Autistic girls are sometimes better at controlling their behavior in public. They might have learned early on 
      to smile or make eye contact. They might also be more interested in making friends than boys with autism are. All of this 
      can make for a more subtle version of autism that a doctor might not recognize. Some girls with autism get diagnosed with 
      ADHD instead, which can look similar on the surface. When girls with autism don’t get diagnosed, they miss out on support 
      that can help them understand their challenges, build skills and excel in school. They might get exhausted from trying so 
      hard to fit in or be bullied because they miss social cues. That can lead to depression, anxiety, or low self-esteem. 
      Therapists might not see that autism is the underlying cause. Getting diagnosed early on is important so girls can get the 
      support they need as soon as possible.
