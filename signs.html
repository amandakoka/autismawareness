      Far more boys than girls are diagnosed with autism. But that might not be because more boys have 
      autism. Often, autism in girls just looks different from the stereotype of autistic behavior, so some doctors might not diagnose 
      it They might have learned early on to smile or make eye contact. They might also be more interested in making friends than boys 
      with autism are. All of this can make for a more subtle version of autism that a doctor might not recognize. Some girls with 
      autism get diagnosed with ADHD instead, which can look similar on the surface. When girls with autism don’t get diagnosed, 
      they miss out on support that can help them understand their challenges, build skills and excel in school. They might get 
      exhausted from trying so hard to fit in or be bullied because they miss social cues. That can lead to depression, anxiety, 
      or low self-esteem. Getting diagnosed early on is important so girls can get the support they need as soon as possible.
